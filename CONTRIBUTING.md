# How to contribute with images

##### I have designed an image that is perfect for Prolus!
Awesome! Please go to [this page](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzSHE5TaXGg6Fd5HyrNcw6lNzi-ZdrXxV1r7kU-4WrIPX8MA/viewform) to upload your image, you can see guidelines for posting images on there.

##### This person has some awesome images, is it ok if i just copy his images and upload them for Prolus?
No, that's not ok.
If we don't have their approval we can't use them. You can consider asking them if they want to upload their images to Prolus.
Just remember: Stealing other peoples work is not cool.
